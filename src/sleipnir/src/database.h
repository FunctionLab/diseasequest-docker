 * \brief
 * Encapsulates a simple indexless database allowing rapid per-gene access to values from many datasets.
 * 
 * CDatabase stores essentially the same data as IDataset; that is, a list of genes and, for each gene pair,
 * zero or more discrete values drawn from many datasets.  IDataset exposes this information so that values
 * for many genes can be drawn rapidly from a single dataset.  CDatabase exposes the same information so
 * that values for one gene can be drawn rapidly from many datasets.  A database can be constructed from
 * a Bayes net and its accompanying data files (DABs/QUANTs), although this amounts to something like a
 * very large matrix transposition, so care must be taken with blocking for large sets of data.  CDatabase
 * consumes very little memory, as data is organized on disk and read efficiently on an as-needed basis.
 * 
 * \remarks
 * Data is stored in discretized form (and thus drawn from DAB/QUANT pairs) using only four bits per gene
 * pair per dataset.  This of course means that no dataset can be discretized into more than 15 bins (one
 * value is reserved to indicate missing data).  Data is spread across an arbitrary number of database
 * subfiles, each containing all data associated with one or more genes.  For G genes spread across N
 * subfiles, the nth subfile will contain the G/N genes n, n + G/N, n + 2G/N, and so forth.  Each gene has
 * one value associated with it per gene per dataset, and these are stored in row-major order: gene g's
 * values are stored first for dataset 0, genes 0 through G, then dataset 1, genes 0 through G, and so forth.
 * The layout of each subfile on disk is thus:
 * \code
 * 4 byte unsigned int, size of header (non-data)
 * 4 byte unsigned int G, total number of genes
 * 4 byte unsigned int N, number of datasets
 * 4 byte unsigned int X = ~G/N, number of genes in subfile
 * X null-terminated ASCII strings storing gene names
 * X rows for genes g of the form:
 *   4-bit data values for pairs g,0 through g,G in dataset 0
 *   4-bit data values for pairs g,0 through g,G in dataset 1
 *   ...
 *   4-bit data values for pairs g,0 through g,G in dataset N
 * \endcode
 * It is possible for a CDatabase to be larger than the input DABs, even though it reduces 32-bit floating
 * point values to 4-bit discrete values, since A) each data point is stored twice, once for pair g,h and
 * once for pair h,g, and B) a value must be stored for every gene pair in every dataset, even if it's
 * missing.  These two facts guarantee very rapid database lookups from disk, but they can in the worst
 * case roughly double the size of the data on disk relative to input DABs.

	 * \brief
	 * Construct a new database over the given genes from the given datasets and Bayes net.
	 * 
	 * \param vecstrGenes
	 * Gene names (and size) for the new database.
	 * 
	 * \param strInputDirectory
	 * Directory containing DAB datasets to be collected into the new database.
	 * 
	 * \param pBayesNet
	 * Bayes net with which the resulting database will be used (indicates the order in which the datasets are
	 * stored in the database).
	 * 
	 * \param strOutputDirectory
	 * Directory in which the new database files are generated.
	 * 
	 * \param iFiles
	 * Number of files across which the database should be constructed.
	 * 
	 * \returns
	 * True if the database was constructed successfully.
	 * 
	 * Constructs a new database over the indicated G genes by creating the requested number of new files in the
	 * output directory and, for each gene g, collecting its data in row major order: values for pairs g,0 through
	 * g,G in dataset 0, then dataset 1, and so forth.  Datasets are loaded from the indicated directory and
	 * ordered as specified in the given Bayes net; this allows data to be loaded very rapidly from the resulting
	 * database and immediately inserted into the Bayes net (or one with identical structure) for inference.
	 * 
	 * Note that for large collections of data, this can be an extremely time- and memory-intensive process.
	 * This is due to the fact that, to construct a database row for some gene, every single dataset must be
	 * inspected to collect (and discretize) all values for all pairs including that gene.  For organisms with
	 * large genomes, it's impossible to load more than a few datasets into memory simultaneously - but reloading
	 * every dataset for every gene wastes far too much time loading and reloading data from DAB files, even if
	 * they're memory mapped.
	 * 
	 * The solution is to use blocking: for gene block size b and dataset block size B, load the first B datasets.
	 * Then copy out values for the first b genes.  Then load the next B datasets, copy b genes' values, and so
	 * forth.  Then repeat the whole process for the next b genes, and so on until the entire given gene set has
	 * been covered.  Correctly balancing the input block size (number of datasets to load) and output block size
	 * (number of database subfiles, and thus genes, to produce at once) can reduce the generation time of large
	 * databases from months to hours.
	 * 
	 * \remarks
	 * iFiles should not be substantially larger than 1000 due to filesystem and file handle limits.
