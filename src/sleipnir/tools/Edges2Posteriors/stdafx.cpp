 * Edges2Posteriors calculates the individual contribution of every dataset to every gene pair in a predicted
 * functional relationship network.  This is similar to \ref BNTruster, but the contributions are broken
 * down per gene pair (rather than per dataset value, and the output can thus be \e much larger) and given
 * as the actual difference in posterior probability incurred by each gene pair's individual data values.

 * Output (to standard output) the contribution of each dataset DAT/DAB file in \c data_dir to the
 * predicted functional relationship probabilities in \c predictions.dab based on the Bayesian network
 * \c learned.xdsl; this network must contain node IDs corresponding to the data file names.
