 * \page Hubber Hubber
 * 
 * Hubber calculates the cohesiveness of one or more input gene sets in a given functional relationship (or
 * experimental data) network; it also calculates the association of each gene with those gene sets.  This
 * is primarily useful for predicting function for genes based on "guilt by association" with genes already
 * known to be in those functions (i.e. gene sets).
 * 
 * \section sec_usage Usage
 * 
 * \subsection ssec_usage_basic Basic Usage
 * 
 * \code
 * Hubber -i <network.dab> -g <genes> <contexts.txt>*
 * \endcode
 * 
 * Output (to standard output) the average in- and out-connectivity of each gene set \c contexts.txt in the
 * network \c network.dab; for each context, display the \c genes genes most specifically associated with
 * that context.  In-connectivity is the weight of an edge between two genes in the context; out-connectivity
 * is the weight of an edge incident to a gene in the context.
 * 
 * \code
 * Hubber -i <network.dab> -g -1 <contexts.txt>*
 * \endcode
 * 
 * Output (to standard output) the specificity with which every gene in the genome is associated with
 * each context \c contexts.txt in the network \c network.dab.  Scores for genes already annotated in the
 * context are negative.
 * 
 * \code
 * Hubber -i <global.dab> -o <backgrounds.bin> -x <context_ids.txt> -s <gene_ids.txt>
 *		-d <contexts_dir> <contexts.txt>*
 * \endcode
 * 
 * Save in \c backgrounds.bin the average weight of edges incident to each gene in the global network
 * \c global.dab and in every context-specific network in \c contexts_dir, each corresponding to a
 * context gene list \c contexts.txt.  \c context_ids.txt and \c gene_ids.txt are tab-delimited text
 * files as described below (and used in \ref BNServer) with one-based indices in the first column and
 * context or gene names, respectively, in the second column.
