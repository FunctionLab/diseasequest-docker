 * Data2Bnt converts a collection of DAT/DAB files into a features file appropriate for use with either
 * the MATLAB Bayes Net Toolkit (BNT) or the Weka machine learning package.  Data2Bnt provides one way to
 * bridge the single gene function/gene pair functional relationship gap by producing one example per
 * gene pair, but labeling these examples based on the inclusion of one of that pair's genes in a positive
 * gene set (e.g. pathway/process/complex/etc.)  Similar to \ref Data2Features.

 * \code
 * Data2Bnt -i <positives.txt> -f <features.txt> -d <data.txt> -q <bins.quant> <data.pcl/dab>*
 * \endcode
 * 
 * Generate a feature matrix compatible with BNT in which each row represents a gene pair, labeled positive
 * if one of the genes is in \c positives.txt, with features as described in \c features.txt, default
 * values drawn from \c data.txt, and feature values from the microarray PCL files \c data.pcl or
 * DAT/DAB files \c data.dab.  If PCL files are used, they are discretized using the bin edges in the
 * QUANT file \c bins.quant.
