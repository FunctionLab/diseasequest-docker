 * Funcographer mines heavy subgraphs (clusters) from three inputs: gene set functional associations
 * (e.g. from \ref Funcifier), functional activities between datasets and functions (e.g. from
 * \ref BNTruster), and correlations between datasets' functional activities.  This provides a way of
 * mining large data collections for pathways that are interacting and the datasets in which those
 * pathways are most active.

 * \subsection ssec_usage_basic Basic Usage
 * 
 * \code
 * Funcographer -f <functions.dab> -t <trusts.pcl> -d <datasets.dab> -o <cograph.dab>
 *		-r <initial_specificity> -w <final_specificity_ratio> -Z <datasets>
 * \endcode
 * 
 * Using the process/process associations in \c functions.dab, the dataset/process associations in
 * \c trusts.pcl (from \ref BNTruster), and the dataset/dataset similarities in \c datasets.dab, construct
 * a single graph \c cograph.dab containing both node types and all edges.  Then mine the \c functions.dab
 * portion of this graph, outputting (to standard output) all heavy subgraphs with an initial specificity
 * ratio of at least \c initial_specificity, a final specificity ratio that's at least
 * \c final_specificity_ratio fraction of the initial value, and the \c datasets datasets most strongly
 * associated with those functions.
