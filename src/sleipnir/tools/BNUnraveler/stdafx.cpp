 * 
 * BNUnraveler is a multithreaded tool for performing inference on many context-specific Bayesian classifiers
 * to produce predicted functional relationship networks.  It is generally paired with \ref BNWeaver to
 * learn classifiers from data and then infer context-specific functional relationships.
 * 
 * \section sec_usage Usage

 * \subsection ssec_usage_basic Basic Usage
 * 
 * \code
 * BNUnraveler -i <contexts_dir> -d <data_dir> -o <networks_dir> [-t <threads>]
 *		<contexts.txt>*
 * \endcode
 * 
 * For each biological context \c contexts.txt, load a context-specific Bayesian classifier (of the
 * same name) from \c contexts_dir and use Bayesian inference with the data (named identically to the node
 * IDs in the classifier) from \c data_dir to create a context-specific functional relationship
 * network in \c networks_dir; optionally, use \c threads parallel threads.
