 * 
 * SVMer learns and evaluates support vector machine models from DAT/DAB datasets in a variety of ways.  If
 * given PCL inputs, SVMer will construct one example per gene pair by concatenating the two genes'
 * expression vectors to create features.  If given DAT/DAB inputs, SVMer will construct one example per
 * gene pair using each dataset as a feature.  In genewise mode, SVMer will learn one model per gene,
 * with one example constructed for each pair in which that gene participates.
 * 
 * \section sec_usage Usage
 * 
 * \subsection ssec_usage_basic Basic Usage
 * 
 * \code
 * SVMer -i <answers.dab> -m <learned.svm> <data.pcl/dab>*
 * \endcode
 * 
 * Learn an SVM model \c learned.svm for gene pairs using labels from \c answers.dab and data from \c data.pcl
 * (for features built from PCL conditions) or \c data.dab (for feature values drawn from DAT/DAB files).
 * 
 * \code
 * SVMer -m <learned.svm> -o <predictions.dab> <data.pcl/dab>*
 * \endcode
 * 
 * Using the SVM model in \c learned.svm, predict labels for gene pairs using data from \c data.pcl or
 * \c data.dab and store the resulting predicted functional interaction network in \c predictions.dab.
