 * \page MIer MIer
 * 
 * MIer calculates the mutual information (or other similarity measure) between pairs of input datasets.
 * This can be used to approximate how much information is shared between two experimental datasets or
 * how similar two predicted functional relationship networks are.
 * 
 * \section sec_usage Usage

 * MIer <data.dab>*
 * \endcode
 * 
 * Compute pairwise mutual information scores for each pair of datasets in \c data.dab and output them to
 * standard output.
 * 
 * \subsection ssec_usage_detailed Detailed Usage
 * 
 * Note that to use \ref Counter with the output from \c MIer, you should first convert the table of raw
 * (bit) mutual information scores to exponentially scaled sums of relative shared information.  This can
 * be done using the \c half2relative.rb and \c half2weights.rb scripts included with Sleipnir.  The
 * combination of these two files' outputs creates a weights file appropriate for use with \ref Counter 's
 * alphas parameters. Also note that the calculated measure is on quantized values if .quant files exist in
 * the same directory as .dab files. If no .quant files exist, MIer will write to the error log "could not
 * open quant file" and will proceed using non-quantized values.
