 * 
 * BNWeaver is a multithreaded tool for learning context-specific naive Bayesian classifiers from datasets
 * (DAT/DAB files).  It is generally paired with \ref BNUnraveler to learn classifiers from data and then
 * infer context-specific functional relationships.
 * 
 * \section sec_usage Usage
 * 
 * \subsection ssec_usage_basic Basic Usage
 * 
 * \code
 * BNWeaver -w <answers.dab> -o <contexts_dir> -d <data_dir> [-b <global.xdsl>] [-t <threads>]
 *		<contexts.txt>*
 * \endcode
 * 
 * Using the gold standard answers in \c answers.dab and all DAT/DAB files in \c data_dir, create one
 * context-specific Bayesian classifier in \c contexts_dir for each biological context \c contexts.txt;
 * optionally, use probability tables from \c global.xdsl as fallbacks when insufficient data is available
 * for context-specific learning, and use \c threads parallel threads.
