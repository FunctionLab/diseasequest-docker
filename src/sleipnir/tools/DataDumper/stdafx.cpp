 * DataDumper opens an answer file, multiple datasets, and a Bayesian network and displays the data exactly
 * as it would be provided to the network for Bayesian learning or evaluation.  This provides information on
 * exactly what genes/gene pairs and data are being used for learning under different circumstances.

 * 
 * Output (to standard output) the discretized answers for all gene pairs in \c answers.dab with data from
 * the DAT/DAB files \c data.dab (and associated QUANT files) exactly as it would be used in Bayesian
 * learning.  In combination with the other command line arguments, this allows a user to see exactly what
 * data is being used for learning/evaluation under specific circumstances, e.g. context-specific learning,
 * a holdout test set, etc.
