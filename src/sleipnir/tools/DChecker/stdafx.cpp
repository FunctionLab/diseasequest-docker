 * \page DChecker DChecker
 * 
 * DChecker inputs a gold standard answer file and a DAT/DAB of predicted functional relationships (or
 * other interactions) and outputs the information necessary to perform a performance analysis (ROC curve,
 * precision/recall curve, or AUC score) for the given predictions.
 * 
 * \section sec_usage Usage
 * 
 * \subsection ssec_usage_basic Basic Usage
 * 
 * \code
 * DChecker -w <answers.dab> -i <predictions.dab>
 * \endcode
 * 
 * Output (to standard output) positive gene counts, true and false positive pair counts, true and false
 * negative pair counts, and an overall AUC score using the default binning of continuous data in
 * \c predictions.dab and the binary gold standard answers in \c answers.dab.
 * 
 * \code
 * DChecker -w <answers.dab> -i <predictions.dab> -f
 * \endcode
 * 
 * Output true/false positive and negative pair counts assuming that \c predictions.dab contains only a
 * finite number of different values and using these as bins.  This is appropriate for inherently
 * discrete data, e.g. cocluster counts.
 * 
 * \code
 * DChecker -w <answers.dab> -i <predictions.dab> -b 0 -n -m 0 -M 1 -e 0.01
 * \endcode
 * 
 * Output true/false positive and negative pair counts by normalizing the given data \c predictions.dab to
 * the range [0,1] and creating bin cutoffs at 0.01 increments between 0 and 1.  This can provide a finer
 * grained binning than the default \c -b setting for some prediction/data sets (and a less fine grained
 * binning for others; when in doubt, try both).
 * 
 * \code
 * DChecker -w <answers.dab> -i <predictions.dab> -c <context.txt>
 * \endcode
 * 
 * Output true/false positive and negative pair counts for the given \c predictions.dab using only the gene
 * pairs relevant to the given biological function \c context.txt.  This is appropriate for evaluating
 * context-specific functional relationship predictions.
